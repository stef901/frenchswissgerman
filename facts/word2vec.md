# Röstigraben

...is an expression used for the border between the German-speaking and the French-speaking Switzerland. In English it would be "the Rösti ditch", and it has probably got something with the different (food) cultures to do...

 

# Merci vilmal

...is a nice language mixture. An explanation that I have got, which probably isn't completely true, but funny anyway, is that the German-speaking Swiss wanted to say "merci" instead of "danke", to prove that they weren't German. The problem was only that then they sounded like they were trying to speak French without being very successful (the Swiss German pronunciation of "merci" is rather special). The solution was to add the typical Swiss German ending "vilmal". Then there would be no doubt of where they were coming from.   ....and this is how the expression "merci vilmal" - thanks a lot - may have been created...
